	UpdateLinkRequest
	// The institution name for this link. With the Plaid integration, each link represents a single bank account login
	// with an institution. So if you link your monetr account with your U.S. Bank account you would have one link for
	// U.S. Bank, and your accounts with that bank would show as bank account's under that link. Manual links are
	// intended to be a single "Manual" link per account, with any manually managed bank accounts underneath it.

	// created are also deleted. In an "ownership" sort of way. If a user links their bank account and has that shared

	// the linked bank account.
	CreatedByUserId uint64 `json:"createdByUserId" example:"94832"`

	UpdatedByUserId *uint64 `json:"updatedByUserId" example:"89547" extensions:"x-nullable"`
	// The last time this link was updated. Currently this field is not really maintained, eventually this timestamp
	// will indicate the last time a sync occurred between monetr and Plaid. Manual links don't change this field at
	// all. **OLD**
	UpdatedAt time.Time `json:"updatedAt" example:"2021-05-21T05:24:12.958309Z"`
	// The last time transactions were successfully retrieved for this link. This date does not indicate the most recent
	// transaction retrieved, simply the most recent attempt to retrieve transactions that was successful.
